## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

The goal of Nscout is to provide football clubs with a data-driven tool to enhance their scouting process, reduce biases, and make informed decisions when acquiring new talent. Football scouting traditionally relies on subjective evaluations. Nscout aims to modernise this process by utilising machine learning to provide a more objective solution to:

- Analyse player statistics
- Identify versatile talents
- Provide data-driven insights for recruitment decisions

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Used Kaggle dataset as it already contained a lot of the data needed for the project. However, if money was invested into this project, sources like Opta could provide more up to date data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Utilises a decision tree algorithm to place player's into their best suited position.
- **Prediction Probabilities**: Uses these to identify versatile player's who could perform well across multiple positions.
- **Visualisation**: Provides visual representations of player metrics and comparisons.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
